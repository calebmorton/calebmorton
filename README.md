Hello there! My name is Caleb.

I am 18 years old and will be going to university majoring in Computer Science. I am highly interested in learning machine-level programming as well as
continuing my education in web development. As of now I only know HTML and CSS, but am in the process of soaking in as much knowledge in C before heading off
to college where that will be one of the two main programming languages I will be required to learn (the other one being Java).

Apart from programming and coding in markup languages, I have an interest in music and gaming. I have been playing the drums since I was a baby and have played guitar
for the past 6 years now. I have multiple possible goals that would make for highly fulfilling outcomes in life for when I am graduated from college. I would
love to get into VR development (perhaps even helping to advance VR technology), work for NASA, join the military as an officer, or create my own software/app.
Any of those would make for a dream come true!

If anyone has any advice or tips in coding, feel free to let me know!
